# Marpa::R2 Updates

## About this page

This is the updates page as of Marpa::R2,
version 10.000000.
(For the updates pages for previous versions, see below.)
It may contain descriptions of bugs for which a fix
is in preparation.
It also carries notices which are useful to current users,
but which do not justify a full new distribution,

On CPAN, Marpa::R2's primary distribution mechanism,
there is no way to have true "meta" information --
even a small doc always is part of the distribution itself
and requires the creation of a completely new version.

Marpa is now "stable", and new features are not added to it.
New versions are released only when they benefit users
of the current functionality in a major way.
New versions usually occur only when a serious
bug is discovered.

## Bugs

### No known bugs

As of this writing, there are no known bugs in Marpa::R2 10.000000.

## Notices

### No support for Perl 5.10.0

Marpa::R2 no longer supports Perl 5.10.0.
There do not appear to be any Marpa::R2 users
of Perl 5.10.0.
And, in the cloud,
Perl 5.10.0 is so rare it is hard to find testing for it.

### No support for cperl and other Perl variants

We are happy to see experimentation with Perl,
but unfortunately we do not have
the resources to support anything but standard Perl.
A bug with a Perl variant will be rejected
if the bug cannot be duplicated in standard Perl.
